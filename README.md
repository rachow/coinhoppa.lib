# Coinhoppa.lib 📘

**Coinhoppa** is an experimental project, however as the code base expands, engineering minds begin to ponder on ideas on how to better maintain and separate the business logics
in the platform into more manageable parts. You will hear terms like "**Microservices**" and "**Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)**" in the tech world these days.

Oh, have you heard about "**API Design First**" approach, yeap API's are hot🌶️ and they are built widely. But building REST APIs will involve heavy use of shared modules and files that trigger some
sort of action.

Meet 👋 this one approach, a repo that holds a lot of the core platform processes through a unified structure, making the codebase more manageable and scalable. 

## Installation

Before installation, ask yourself whether these modules and files are required by your Application/SDK/API or any other service.
Follow the practices below.
 - Your consuming project will make use of the PSR standards to invoke the library modules using the namespace `\\Coinhoppa\\`.
 - Your project does and will not conflict with the above namespace.
 - You may create symbolic links to map the namespace to a different location within your path structure.

TBC.
